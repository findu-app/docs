## Development Process

### 1. Before You Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Existing Work">
    - Search for existing PRs addressing the issue
    - Check if someone is already assigned
    - Read any discussion on the issue
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Claim the Issue">
    Comment on the issue: "I'd like to work on this!"
    Wait for assignment before starting major work
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Understand Context">
    - Read related code and tests
    - Check CLAUDE.md in the repository
    - Ask questions if requirements unclear
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Making Changes

Always follow our branch strategy:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[dev branch] --> B[feature/your-branch]
    B --> C[Open PR to dev]
    C --> D[Review & Merge]
    D --> A
```

<Warning>
  Never branch from or PR to `main` directly. Always use `dev` as your base.
</Warning>

### 3. Code Standards

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript/React">
    ```typescript
    // Good: Clear naming, proper types
    interface StudentProfile {
      id: string;
      name: string;
      graduationYear: number;
    }
    
    // Good: Descriptive function names
    export function calculateMatchScore(
      student: StudentProfile,
      school: School
    ): number {
      // Implementation
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Swift/iOS">
    ```swift
    // Good: SwiftUI best practices
    struct StudentCardView: View {
        @StateObject var viewModel: StudentCardViewModel
        
        var body: some View {
            // Clean, composable views
        }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    # Good: Type hints and docstrings
    def calculate_match_score(
        student: StudentProfile,
        school: School
    ) -> float:
        """Calculate match score between student and school.
        
        Returns score between 0.0 and 1.0
        """
        # Implementation
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 4. Testing

Before submitting your PR:

## Review Process

What happens after you open a PR:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Automated Checks">
    GitHub Actions will run:
    - Linting
    - Type checking
    - Tests (if configured)
  </Step>
