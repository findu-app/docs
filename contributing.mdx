## Development Process

### 1. Starting New Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Current Sprint">
    - Review sprint board for assigned tasks
    - Check with team lead for priorities
    - Understand acceptance criteria
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Pull Latest Changes">
    Always start from updated dev branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout dev
    git pull origin dev
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create Feature Branch">
    Use descriptive branch names:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/add-scholarship-filters
    git checkout -b fix/profile-creation-bug
    git checkout -b chore/update-dependencies
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Making Changes

Always follow our branch strategy:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[dev branch] --> B[feature/your-branch]
    B --> C[Open PR to dev]
    C --> D[Review & Merge]
    D --> A
```

<Warning>
  Never branch from or PR to `main` directly. Always use `dev` as your base.
</Warning>

### 3. Code Standards

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript/React">
    ```typescript
    // Good: Clear naming, proper types
    interface StudentProfile {
      id: string;
      name: string;
      graduationYear: number;
    }
    
    // Good: Descriptive function names
    export function calculateMatchScore(
      student: StudentProfile,
      school: School
    ): number {
      // Implementation
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Swift/iOS">
    ```swift
    // Good: SwiftUI best practices
    struct StudentCardView: View {
        @StateObject var viewModel: StudentCardViewModel
        
        var body: some View {
            // Clean, composable views
        }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Python">
    ```python
    # Good: Type hints and docstrings
    def calculate_match_score(
        student: StudentProfile,
        school: School
    ) -> float:
        """Calculate match score between student and school.
        
        Returns score between 0.0 and 1.0
        """
        # Implementation
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 4. Testing

Before submitting your PR:

- [ ] Run existing tests
- [ ] Add tests for new functionality
- [ ] Test manually in the app
- [ ] Check for console errors
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness (if web)

### 5. Pull Request

Use our simplified PR template:

```markdown
## What does this PR do?
[Brief description]

## Type of change
- Bug fix / New feature / Improvement

## How did you test this?
- [ ] I tested this locally
- [ ] Specific things I tested: [list them]

## Screenshots (if UI changes)
[Add screenshots]
```

## Review Process

What happens after you open a PR:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Automated Checks">
    GitHub Actions will run:
    - Linting
    - Type checking
    - Security checks
    - Build verification
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Code Review">
    Team members will review:
    - Code quality and standards
    - Architecture alignment
    - Performance impact
    - Security considerations
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Testing">
    - Verify changes work locally
    - Test on dev environment
    - Check for regressions
    - Mobile app: test on devices
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Merge & Deploy">
    Once approved:
    - PR merged to dev
    - Auto-deployed to dev environment
    - Monitor for issues
    - Plan production release
  </Step>
</Steps>
