# Developer Initial Setup

Welcome to FindU! This guide will help you set up your development environment and get you coding in minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Git** (v2.30+)
- **Node.js** (v18+ LTS recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **Supabase CLI** (optional, for database work)
- **Claude Code** (optional, for AI-assisted development)

<Check>
**Pro tip:** If you're on macOS, you can install most prerequisites using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install git node supabase/tap/supabase
```
</Check>

## Quick Start

The fastest way to get started is using our automated setup script:

```bash
# Clone the dev-tools repository
git clone https://github.com/findu-app/dev-tools.git

# Run the setup script
cd dev-tools
./scripts/setup.sh
```

This script will:
1. Clone all FindU repositories
2. Install dependencies for each project
3. Create your `.env.local` configuration
4. Set up pre-commit hooks
5. Configure MCP for Claude Code (if installed)

## What Gets Installed

After running the setup script, you'll have:

```
~/findu/
â”œâ”€â”€ dev-tools/          # Developer tools and scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ ios_app/           # iOS mobile app
â”œâ”€â”€ web_app/           # React dashboard
â”œâ”€â”€ supabase/          # Database & edge functions
â”œâ”€â”€ school_matching/   # ML matching engine
â”œâ”€â”€ data_scraping/     # Data collection scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/              # Documentation (this site!)
â”œâ”€â”€ .env.local         # Your environment config
â””â”€â”€ findu              # CLI wrapper
```

## Environment Configuration

The setup script creates a `.env.local` file in your findu root directory. This file controls which environment you're working with (development or production).

<Warning>
Never commit `.env.local` to version control! It contains sensitive credentials.
</Warning>

To switch environments:

```bash
# Switch to development
./findu env switch dev

# Switch to production (be careful!)
./findu env switch prod

# Check current environment
./findu env status
```
