# New Developer Onboarding

Welcome to FindU! This checklist ensures you have everything needed to start contributing.

## Pre-Setup Checklist

Complete these items before running the setup script:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request Access">
    Contact your team lead to get:
    - [ ] GitHub organization invite
    - [ ] Supabase project access
    - [ ] Slack workspace invite
    - [ ] Railway team access (if needed)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Accept Invitations">
    Check your email and accept:
    - [ ] GitHub organization invitation
    - [ ] Supabase project invitations (dev + prod)
    - [ ] Slack workspace invitation
    - [ ] Any other pending invites
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install Prerequisites">
    ```bash
    # macOS (using Homebrew)
    brew install git node python3 supabase/tap/supabase
    
    # Install Docker Desktop
    # Download from: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
    
    # Verify installations
    git --version        # Should be 2.30+
    node --version       # Should be 18+
    python3 --version    # Should be 3.8+
    supabase --version   # Latest version
    docker --version     # Docker Desktop should be running
    ```
    
    For iOS development also install:
    - [ ] Xcode from App Store
    - [ ] CocoaPods: `sudo gem install cocoapods`
    
    <Warning>
      Make sure Docker Desktop is running before proceeding. You'll see a whale icon in your menu bar.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Environment Setup

Once you have access, set up your development environment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Credentials">
    Ask your team lead for:
    - Development Supabase credentials
    - Production Supabase credentials (view-only)
    - Any API keys needed
    
    <Warning>
      Never share these credentials or commit them to Git!
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run Setup Script">
    ```bash
    # Clone dev-tools
    git clone https://github.com/findu-app/dev-tools.git
    
    # Run setup from parent directory (NOT from inside dev-tools!)
    ./dev-tools/scripts/setup.sh
    ```
    
    The script will:
    - Clone all repositories
    - Create `.env.local` template
    - Optionally install dependencies (answer 'y' for full setup)
    - Create the `findu` CLI tool
    
    <Note>
      Full setup with dependencies takes 15-20 minutes. You can skip dependency installation and run it later.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Setup">
    ```bash
    # Check CLI is working
    ./findu env status
    
    # Should show: Current environment: dev
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
